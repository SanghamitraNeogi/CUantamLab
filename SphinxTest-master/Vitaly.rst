**Heat and charge transport in cage-like systems with interstitials**

* Representative configurations of bulk Si with Ge interstitials studied using (a) classical MD and (b) first-principles DFT method. The MD configuration consists of 4096 host Si (yellow) and 64 interstitial Ge (green) atoms. The DFT configuration has 64 Si (yellow) and 1 Ge (green) atoms. The concentration of Ge in bulk Si is 1.56% in both configurations.
